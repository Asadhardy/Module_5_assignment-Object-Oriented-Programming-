    "Answer:\n",
    "    The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two or more classes that ,\n",
    "    share a common base class.\n",
    "    This created uncertainty because it is unclear which path should be followed to inherit methods or attributes\n",
    "    from the shared base class.\n",
    "    The structure forms a diamond shape in the inheritance hierarchy .\n",
    "    Hence, It is know as \"diamond problem\"\n",

    "#This uncertainty is call diamond problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to resolve it:\n",
    "    python resolves the diamond problem using method Resolution Order(MRO).\n",
    "    Python follows the C3 Linearization Algorithm to determine the order in which classes are searched for the,\n",
    "    methods or attribute.\n",
    "    This ensures that the search path is consistent, follows a clear hierarchy and avoids uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple language:\n",
    "    Python first checks the method in the current class (D), it method is not there,\n",
    "    Then it moves to the first parent (B), and if not found , it will move to the second parent (C) in search of method \n",
    "    and finally to the base class (A)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check MRO using the mro() method or the __mro__ attribute.\n",
    "Example to check the MRO:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "print(D.mro())\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "    The Mro determined that the search order for method show() is D -> B -> C -> A.\n",
    "    So, d.show() will call the show() method from the class B first , \n",
    "    as it appears before C in the MRO.(positionally in while inheriting the classes)\n",

    "Insights:\n",
    "    The diamond problem in multiple inheritance can create uncertainty when multiple classes inherit from a shared,\n",
